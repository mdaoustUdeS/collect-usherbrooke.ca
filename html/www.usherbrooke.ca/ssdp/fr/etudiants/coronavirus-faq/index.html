Nous tenions à vous préciser que, pour le moment, l’Ordre des infirmières et infirmiers du Québec (OIIQ) n’a procédé à aucune modification concernant les moments où peut avoir lieu l’externat en soins infirmiers dans les établissements de santé publics ou privés conventionnés.

Un courriel automatique vous sera envoyé pour vous informer que   vous avez été choisi.e. Dès ce moment, le compteur commence à tourner. Si la   première personne refuse, le ou la candidate suivante est informée de la   disponibilité du poste. Et ainsi de suite. Il se pourrait qu'un employeur.e donne sa réponse la fin de semaine. Il est donc important de vérifier vos courriels @USherbrooke tous les jours.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr style="height:82.5pt"><td class="xl65" rowspan="1" style="height: 82.5pt">Est-ce que le délai de 24 h est aussi en fonction la fin de semaine?</td><td class="xl65" rowspan="1" style="width: 383pt">Si un.e employeur.e dépose ses cotes durant la fin de semaine (samedi ou dimanche), les étudiant.e.s auront 24 heures ouvrables, soit jusqu’au lundi 23h59 pour faire connaître leur choix.

La règle du   premier arrivé, premier servi prévaut dans le cas des employeur.e.s. Nous les   incitons cependant à donner leur choix rapidement afin de vous permettre une   plus grande latitude.
