<p class="bodytext">Afin de maintenir une communication efficace avec les étudiants, la Faculté et l’AGEG ont convenu partager les questions les plus fréquentes et les réponses officielles. Vous avez une question? N’hésitez pas à la formuler à l’<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#118;&#112;&#97;&#112;&#64;&#97;&#103;&#101;&#103;&#46;&#99;&#97;">AGEG</a> ou à la <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#111;&#118;&#105;&#100;&#49;&#57;&#46;&#103;&#101;&#110;&#105;&#101;&#64;&#117;&#115;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#98;&#114;&#111;&#111;&#107;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#97;">Faculté</a> ! Nous sommes là pour vous.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>Q Est-ce qu’un problème technique (mauvaise connexion réseau, problème d’ordinateur, etc.) pourrait me pénaliser pour mes examens ?</b><br /><br />R La Faculté a demandé au personnel enseignant de penser à des mesures alternatives (plan B) pour de telles situations. Néanmoins, si une étudiante ou un étudiant vivait une telle difficulté, il faut en aviser sans délai la personne enseignante.<br /><br /><b>Q Pourquoi est-ce que ma charge de travail a augmenté ou est restée la même ? Est-ce que les professeurs doivent diminuer celles-ci ?</b><br /><br />R La Faculté a demandé au personnel enseignant de limiter les évaluations aux apprentissages essentiels. Elle fait confiance à son personnel pour que ce soit le cas. Deux dimensions sont à considérer&nbsp;:<br /><br />1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certaines activités sont particulièrement exigeantes (les projets d’intégration par exemple), mais ces activités permettent aussi de valider des apprentissages essentiels.<br /><br />2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Le contexte de formation à distance peut affecter l’efficacité des étudiantes et étudiants à réaliser des activités, ce qui se traduit par une charge plus importante.<br /><br />Dans tous les cas, il importe d’échanger ouvertement avec le personnel enseignant.<br /><br /><b>Q Mon environnement de travail à distance n’est pas optimal (distractions, stress, cohabitation, etc.). Que puis-je faire?</b><br /><br />R Chaque étudiante et étudiant vit une réalité qui lui est propre. <a >Le Service à la vie étudiante propose des mesures de </a><a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/etudiants/soutien-a-la-reussite/soutien-a-lapprentissage/" target="_blank">soutien à l’apprentissage</a> susceptibles de vous aider&nbsp;.<br /><br /><b>Q Il me manque plusieurs programmes pour effectuer des projets/devoirs. Comment puis-je les avoir sur mon ordinateur ? </b><br /><br />R Le personnel informatique a mis en place la technologie <a href="https://usherbrooke.sharepoint.com/sites/fgen/SitePages/Ressources-informatiques.aspx" class="external-link-new-window" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre">Remote-Lab</a>, vous donnant accès aux programmes normalement présents sur les ordinateurs de nos laboratoires.<br /><br /><b>Q Quelles sont les ressources afin de soutenir la santé mentale étudiante?</b><br /><br />Si vous vivez de l’inquiétude par rapport à votre situation, diverses ressources sont déjà à votre disposition. D’abord, sachez que de <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/coronavirus/faq/aide-psychologique/" target="_blank">l’aide psychologique</a> est toujours disponible. Vous pouvez également contacter les&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/genie/futurs-etudiants/1er-cycle/aide-a-la-vie-etudiante/">Aides à la vie étudiante (AVE)</a> de la Faculté de génie ou l'<a href="https://www.ageg.ca/" target="_blank">AGEG</a>, avec qui nous sommes en constante communication. Enfin, le site <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/promo/udes/ressources-bien-etre/" target="_blank">Ressources et conseils bien-être</a> présente des capsules vidéo et témoignages qui peuvent vous faire du bien!<br /><br /><b>Q Pourquoi le personnel enseignant ne change-t-il pas les examens pour des travaux plus convenables à un contexte de formation à distance (devoirs, rapports, etc.) ?</b><br /><br />Le personnel enseignant a été sensibilisé aux défis que représente la réalisation d’examens à distance et encouragé à adopter des mesures alternatives d’évaluation. Dans certains cas, l’examen demeure la modalité la plus pertinente ou la plus connue par l’enseignant. La Faculté continue à offrir un support technopédagogique à son personnel enseignant pour l’aider à diversifier ses pratiques.<br /><br /><b>Q Que se passera-t-il avec les stages ? </b><br /><br />Le Service des stages et du développement professionnel (SSDP) propose une <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/ssdp/fr/etudiants/coronavirus-faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a> très détaillée.<br /><br /><b>Q Y aura-t-il une possibilité de plus de places dans les cours de l’été puisque plusieurs stages ont été annulés ?</b><br /><br />Il sera possible, pour certains programmes et certains cours, d’accueillir plus d’étudiantes et d’étudiants. Vous devez rapidement communiquer avec votre coordonnatrice ou coordonnateur académique.<br /><br />Par ailleurs, un assouplissement des règles de stage permet de commencer un stage jusqu’à la fin juin. Le SSDP et la Faculté de génie sont très actifs pour trouver des stages aux personnes non encore placées. N’hésitez pas à communiquer avec le SSDP à l’adresse <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#111;&#111;&#112;&#64;&#117;&#115;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#98;&#114;&#111;&#111;&#107;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#97;">coop&#64;usherbrooke&#46;ca</a>.<br /><br /><b>Q Qu’arrive-t-il si un de mes proches ou moi tombe malade ? Est-ce que les procédures pour justifier mon absence sont applicables ?</b><br /><br />Non. Informez dès que possible votre coordonnatrice ou coordonnateur académique, consultez la page sur <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/coronavirus/symptomes-et-precautions/symptomes/" target="_blank">symptômes et mesures</a> à prendre… et prenez soin de vous.<br /><br /><b>Q Si je suis en probation, vais-je avoir droit à un assouplissement des règles pour augmenter ma moyenne générale en haut de 2.0 ?</b><br /><br />Une réponse officielle sera disponible sous peu.<br /><br /><b>Q Est-ce qu’il sera possible de modifier notre cheminement scolaire normalement fixe en raison de la crise ?</b><br /><br />Pour s’adapter au contexte inédit de la pandémie, les programmes ont dû mettre en place des mesures particulières. Certaines activités sont annulées, d’autres sont reportées à un trimestre ultérieur. Communiquez avec votre coordonnatrice ou coordonnateur académique.<br /><br /><b>Q Comment les projets de fin de baccalauréat pourront-ils se faire dans le contexte?</b><br /><br />Les programmes élaborent des scénarios. Lorsque la présence sur le campus sera possible, des mesures pourront être élaborées dans le respect des directives gouvernementales.<br /><br /><b>Q Si le gouvernement permet un retour dans les universités avant la fin de la session d’été, les étudiants pourront-ils accéder au Studio de création et aux laboratoires à partir de ce moment?</b><br /><br />Les formations continueront d’être données à distance par souci d’équité envers les personnes qui ne sont pas en présence. Si l’accès aux édifices et laboratoires est possible, des mesures pourront être élaborées dans le respect des directives gouvernementales.<br /><br /><b>Q Dans l’éventualité où l’université demeure physiquement fermée même à l’automne, comment l’accueil des nouveaux étudiants se fera?</b><br /><br />Cette éventualité n’est pas encore à l’étude. Nous demeurons attentifs aux orientations gouvernementales. L’AGEG et la Faculté devront être créatifs, mais ils veilleront à assurer une bonne intégration des nouvelles étudiantes et nouveaux étudiants.</li></ul><h2 class="accordeon">Accès à l’UdeS</h2>

Cette mesure vise à assurer le salaire du personnel déjà rémunéré à partir de subventions et contrats de recherche (APAPUS, SEESUS, stagiaires postdoctoraux, étudiantes et étudiants). Les modalités de ce plan de soutien institutionnel seront annoncées très bientôt. Il est important de souligner que ces mesures exceptionnelles seront appliquées <b>en complément </b>aux plans de soutien des organismes subventionnaires. <b>Les professeures et professeurs devront prioritairement utiliser les plans de soutien des organismes pour combler les pertes engendrées par les mesures de confinement en lien avec la COVID-19</b>.</li></ul>
