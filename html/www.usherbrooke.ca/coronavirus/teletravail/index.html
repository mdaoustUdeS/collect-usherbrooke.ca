<h2 class="accordeon">Prévenir les blessures</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Même en situation de télétravail, il est important d’adopter une bonne posture de travail aﬁn de limiter le risque de développer des troubles musculo-squelettiques&nbsp;:</p><ul><li>Assurez-vous de bien avancer la chaise près de votre bureau ou de la table aﬁn d’éviter de vous pencher. Vous devez avoir la tête alignée avec le bas de votre dos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Alignez vos poignets et vos coudes avec votre clavier, soit à l'aide de vos appuis-bras (si vous avez une tirette à clavier) ou en travaillant directement sur la table (à ce moment, les appuis-bras deviennent inutiles).</li><li>Ajustez la hauteur de votre ou de vos écrans de manière à ce que vos yeux arrivent 2 pouces sous le rebord supérieur de l'écran.</li><li>Maintenez une distance d'environ un bras allongé entre vous et votre écran.</li><li>Ayez un éclairage suffisant et évitez de projeter de la lumière directement sur votre ou vos écrans (afin d'éviter de créer des reflets).</li><li>Assurez-vous d'avoir les pieds au sol (ne croisez pas les jambes) et que la hauteur de votre chaise est adéquate pour avoir les épaules détendues (assoyez-vous sur un coussin, au besoin).</li></ul><h2 class="accordeon">Choisir une chaise adéquate</h2><ul><li>Choisissez une chaise de bureau ajustable, avec appui lombaire. Si vous n’en avez pas, optez pour une chaise droite (exemple&nbsp;: une chaise de cuisine) avec un coussin mince ou une serviette roulée que vous placerez au niveau du bas de votre dos.</li><li>Si votre chaise est trop haute, appuyez vos pieds sur un repose (commercial ou maison, comme une boîte ou des livres).</li></ul><h2 class="accordeon">Si vous travaillez avec un portable</h2>
<p class="bodytext">L'ordinateur portable n'est pas recommandé d'un point de vue ergonomique, puisqu’il est impossible d’avoir l’écran à la bonne hauteur, l’écran et le clavier ne pouvant être séparés.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Si vous n'avez d'autre choix, minimisez vos risques de blessures en optant pour l'une ou l'autre des deux solutions suivantes&nbsp;:</p><ul><li>Utilisez un clavier et une souris externes, et installez votre portable sur un support afin que l'écran arrive à la hauteur de vos yeux.</li><li>Connectez votre appareil à un écran externe, et servez-vous du clavier ou du pavé tactile du portable, mais en vous assurant d'entrefermer l'écran.</li></ul><h2 class="accordeon">L’importance des micropauses</h2>
<p class="bodytext">En télétravail comme au bureau, vous ne devriez jamais travailler plus d'une heure sans bouger. Levez-vous, étirez-vous, allez boire&nbsp;: les micropauses actives favorisent la circulation sanguine!</p>
<h2 class="accordeon">En cas d'accident de travail, de blessure ou de douleur</h2><ul><li>Si vous avez une blessure de type musculo-squelettique ou une douleur causée par votre position&nbsp;à votre poste de télétravail, nous vous invitons à remplir une&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/immeubles/fileadmin/sites/immeubles/documents/sante_securite/Procedure_evaluation_te__le__travail.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/immeubles/fileadmin/sites/immeubles/documents/sante_securite/procedure_evaluation_te__le__travail.pdf" tabindex="-1">demande d’évaluation ergonomique en contexte de télétravail</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>Si, dans le cadre de vos activités de télétravail, vous vous blessez, vous devez communiquer avec les services de la sécurité en composant le 819&nbsp;821-7699 (Sherbrooke)&nbsp;ou le 450&nbsp;463-6599&nbsp;(Longueuil) afin de rapporter votre accident de travail.
