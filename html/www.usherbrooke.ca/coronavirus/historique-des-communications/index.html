			<h2 class="accordeon">Mardi 10 novembre 2020 – 09 h 15&nbsp;: [Message aux membres du personnel] État de la situation pour les activités aux campus de Sherbrooke</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Bonjour,</p>
<p class="bodytext">La récente annonce du gouvernement du Québec de faire passer la région de l'Estrie en zone rouge nous amène à revoir les consignes concernant les activités qui se tiennent au Campus principal et au Campus de la santé. Ces nouvelles directives ne signifient pas que nos campus ne sont plus sécuritaires&nbsp;- les plus récents bilans démontrent de façon éloquente qu'ils le sont. Avec cette annonce, le gouvernement souhaite plutôt réduire la circulation dans les établissements d'enseignement supérieur concernés.</p>
<h3>Télétravail privilégié</h3>
<p class="bodytext">À l'instar du Campus de Longueuil, qui se trouve déjà en zone rouge, nous encourageons le télétravail dans l'ensemble des activités pour lesquelles cela est possible tout en conservant la même prestation de travail. Il appartient aux gestionnaires de chacune des unités administratives, en collaboration avec leurs équipes, d'évaluer les activités qui seront favorisées en télétravail et celles qui devront se poursuivre en présentiel pour assurer l'efficience et la qualité des services rendus à l'ensemble des clientèles desservies.</p>
<p class="bodytext">À compter de vendredi, la plupart des activités d'enseignement se tiendront à distance, à l'exception des activités de simulation clinique, des laboratoires d'enseignement, des apprentissages pratiques et d'autres activités ciblées par les directions facultaires ou les directions de programme, qui pourront se poursuivre sur place. Les activités de recherche pourront être maintenues en présence si la nature de la recherche effectuée le nécessite. Les travaux d'équipe requérant une présence pourront continuer de se dérouler sur nos campus, dans le respect des consignes sociosanitaires, incluant le port obligatoire d'un masque de procédure en tout temps, lequel sera fourni. Les examens ou d'autres formes d'évaluations identifiées par les facultés pourront aussi se tenir en présentiel. Les facultés communiqueront rapidement avec leurs étudiantes et étudiants pour les informer des modalités qui s'appliquent à chacune des activités pédagogiques.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Les comptoirs de prêts des bibliothèques demeureront accessibles, de même que les locaux de travail individuel. Les services d'aide, comme l'aide psychologique, demeureront offerts aux étudiantes et étudiants. Les activités de stages sont maintenues, en cohérence avec les consignes sanitaires de chacun des milieux.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Les concessionnaires demeureront ouverts sur les campus. La cafétéria principale sera accessible pour permettre l'achat de repas à emporter seulement. Le Centre sportif restera aussi ouvert, bien que certaines activités puissent se voir annulées. Les informations sur les activités maintenues seront communiquées sous peu par les services concernés.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Soyez assurés que nous déployons tous les efforts nécessaires pour continuer d'offrir les activités qui requièrent la présence sur les campus. Nous vous rappelons l'importance de respecter les mesures sociosanitaires en vigueur, afin de maintenir un environnement sécuritaire pour l'ensemble de notre communauté.&nbsp;Le recours au <a href="../symptomes-et-consignes/formulaire-de-declaration-covid-19/index.html" target="_top">formulaire de déclaration de COVID-19 en ligne</a>&nbsp;doit aussi se poursuivre pour la déclaration des <a href="../symptomes-et-consignes/symptomes-et-precautions/index.html" target="_top">symptômes pouvant être liés à la maladie,</a>&nbsp;et lors de l'obtention d'un résultat à un test de dépistage, qu'il soit positif ou négatif, et que vous soyez ou non en présence sur les campus.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Forte de l'expérience réussie vécue cet automne, alors que 60&nbsp;% des activités d'enseignement ont pu se tenir en présentiel, l'annonce d'aujourd'hui ne change pas la résolution de l'Université de Sherbrooke de maintenir la même approche pour le trimestre d'hiver&nbsp;2021, dans le respect de toutes les consignes qui s'appliqueront pour chacun de ses campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Peu importe comment la situation sanitaire du Québec évoluera, nous pouvons déjà toutes et tous être fiers de ce que nous avons accompli. Je veux remercier tous les membres de la communauté universitaire de leur collaboration exceptionnelle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Le recteur,<br />P<sup>r</sup>&nbsp;Pierre Cossette</p>

<p class="bodytext">Bonjour,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Afin d'accorder un répit à ses personnes étudiantes en contexte de pandémie, l'Université de Sherbrooke prolongera la période de pause entre les trimestres d'automne et d'hiver en reportant au 11 janvier 2021 la date du début du trimestre d'hiver, et ce, pour la majorité des programmes d'études1. Toutefois, les personnes étudiantes en stage devront se conformer aux dates établies par leur milieu de stage.</p>
<p class="bodytext">La date de fin du trimestre d'hiver prévue au plus tard le 30 avril demeure inchangée pour l'ensemble des programmes d'études, de même que la semaine de relâche qui aura lieu du 1<sup>er</sup> au 5 mars 2021.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Par ailleurs, la date limite pour apporter des modifications (retrait, ajout, substitution) au choix des activités pédagogiques du trimestre d'hiver, normalement prévue le 21 janvier, est repoussée au 27 janvier, pour les programmes<sup>1</sup> dont la date de début des activités pédagogiques est le 11 janvier.</p>
<p class="bodytext">De plus, la date limite pour l'annulation ou le remboursement des frais du trimestre d'hiver, normalement prévue le 21 janvier, est repoussée au 27 janvier pour les programmes1 dont la date de début des activités pédagogiques est le 11 janvier.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous vous souhaitons une belle fin de session d'études.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Afin de se conformer à la plus récente mise à jour de l'Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) et de la Commission des normes de l'équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (CNESST), l'UdeS procédera à des ajustements aux mesures sociosanitaires concernant le port des équipements de protection individuelle en contextes de travail.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Il est à noter que ces ajustements s'appliquent uniquement aux membres du personnel et aux personnes étudiantes embauchées par l'UdeS, et non à l'ensemble de la communauté étudiante.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">À compter de ce jeudi 29 octobre, le port d'un masque de procédure plutôt que le couvre-visage sera requis lors de tout déplacement. Dans le cas du personnel ayant à interagir à moins de 2 mètres avec des usagères et usagers, le port de lunettes ou de visière sera requis, en plus du masque de procédure, s'il n'y a pas de barrière physique. Cette consigne ne s'applique toutefois pas lors d'interactions à moins de 2 mètres entre collègues portant toutes et tous un masque de procédure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Des masques de procédure homologués seront fournis par les directions de chaque unité, à raison d'un maximum de 2 par quart de travail. Si le masque est mouillé, souillé ou abîmé, il doit être changé. Il est important de ne pas utiliser d'autres équipements que ceux fournis, puisque les masques vendus en magasin ne sont pas toujours homologués.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Un partenariat précurseur en valorisation&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Plaçant les principes de développement durable au cœur de ses valeurs, l'Université de Sherbrooke se soucie particulièrement de l'impact environnemental de ces nouvelles mesures. Des équipes ont travaillé activement à la recherche de solutions, et une entente partenariale régionale inédite de valorisation des masques de procédure pourra être mise en place au cours des prochaines semaines. L'Université fera office de pionnière dans le cadre de cette initiative de valorisation novatrice.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">La direction de votre unité vous donnera des indications sur le processus de distribution et de récupération des équipements de protection individuelle. D'ici à ce que l'entente soit effective, les masques de procédure doivent être jetés aux rebuts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Pour plus d'information, nous vous invitons à consulter <b><a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/coronavirus/symptomes-et-precautions/precautions/pour-les-membres-du-personnel/" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">le site Coronavirus</a></b>, qui détaille notamment la manière de porter et d'enlever le masque de procédure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bodytext">Forte de l’expérience positive vécue cet automne, l’Université de  Sherbrooke compte poursuivre sur cet élan et privilégier au trimestre  d’hiver 2021 un maximum d’activités pédagogiques en présentiel, dans le  respect de toutes les mesures sociosanitaires qui s’appliqueront à cette  période pour chacun de ses campus. Les activités pédagogiques se feront  selon une approche équilibrée, combinant séances en présence et séances  à distance, en empruntant des formes et modalités diverses. Celles-ci  s’appuieront sur les forces de notre université, tout en respectant les  caractéristiques distinctives de chaque programme. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Cette orientation vise la santé globale des étudiantes et étudiants  et s’inscrit en cohérence avec la volonté de l’Université de Sherbrooke  de tout mettre en œuvre pour favoriser leur réussite et leur offrir une  expérience universitaire riche et significative, qui comportera un  maximum d’échanges directs avec leurs collègues et le personnel  enseignant.  </p>
<p class="bodytext">Le travail méticuleux déployé pour s’assurer que nos campus soient  sécuritaires pour le trimestre d’automne a porté fruit. L’Université a  fait preuve d’une agilité exemplaire pour s’adapter en continu aux  nouvelles réalités et elle continuera de le faire. Cette réussite est  attribuable notamment à la mobilisation de toute notre communauté  universitaire et à de solides partenariats avec la Santé publique de  l’Estrie et de la Montérégie. </p>

<p class="bodytext">Message à tous les membres du personnel,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Le gouvernement du Québec a émis hier de nouvelles directives qui touchent les institutions d'enseignement supérieur en zone rouge. Cela nous amène à revoir certaines consignes que nous avions émises la semaine dernière pour les activités d'enseignement au Campus de Longueuil. Ces nouvelles directives ne signifient pas que nos campus ne sont plus sécuritaires mais plutôt que le gouvernement souhaite réduire au minimum la circulation dans les établissements d'enseignement supérieur concernés.<br /><br /><b>Campus de Longueuil - Zone rouge</b><br /><br />Au Campus de Longueuil, la plupart des activités d'enseignement se tiendront à distance à compter de ce jeudi, à l'exception des activités de simulation cliniques, des laboratoires d'enseignement et d'autres activités ciblées, qui pourront se poursuivre sur place. Les examens pourront se tenir en présentiel. Les responsables de programmes sont invités à communiquer rapidement avec leurs étudiantes et étudiants pour les informer des modalités qui s'appliquent à chacune des activités pédagogiques.<br /><br />Les activités de recherche, incluant les centres et les laboratoires affiliés, peuvent être maintenues en présence si la nature de la recherche effectuée le nécessite. Les comptoirs de prêts de la bibliothèque demeureront accessibles, de même que les locaux de travail individuels, qui devront être réservés au préalable au comptoir de l'accueil du Campus. Les services répondant à des besoins urgents, comme l'aide psychologique, demeureront offerts en présentiel aux étudiantes et étudiants lorsque requis. Les activités de stages sont maintenues, en cohérence avec les consignes sanitaires de chacun des milieux de stage en zone rouge. Le Centre sportif de Longueuil sera quant à lui fermé à compter de jeudi.<br /><br />Nous encourageons le télétravail dans l'ensemble des activités pour lesquelles cela est possible tant et aussi longtemps que le Campus de Longueuil sera visé par le décret sur les zones rouges.<br /><br /><b>Campus principal et Campus de la santé - Zone orange</b><br /><br />Les deux campus de Sherbrooke étant en zone orange, les activités pédagogiques qui se tiennent actuellement en présentiel sont maintenues telles qu'elles ont été planifiées. Il en est de même pour les activités de recherche, les cliniques d'enseignement, les laboratoires et les examens, qui se poursuivent sur place. Les bibliothèques et le Centre sportif demeurent ouverts, de même que les cafétérias.<br /><br />Par ailleurs, le gouvernement demande à tous les établissements d'enseignement supérieur d'être prêts pour un éventuel basculement en zone rouge. En conséquence, malgré la stabilité de la situation en Estrie et l'absence d'éclosion sur nos campus, la direction de l'Université a décidé de permettre dès la semaine prochaine un passage au télétravail dans les fonctions administratives où cela est possible, tout en permettant la poursuite des activités d'enseignement et de recherche. Il appartient aux gestionnaires de chacune des unités administratives, en collaboration avec leurs équipes, d'évaluer les activités qui seront favorisées en télétravail et celles qui devront se poursuivre en présentiel pour assurer l'efficience et la qualité des services rendus à l'ensemble des clientèles desservies.<br /><br />La mobilité interrégionale est autorisée pour les activités et services considérés nécessaires ou essentiels comme les activités de stage, de recherche et d'enseignement ainsi que les examens et le travail.<br /><br />L'Université déploie tous les efforts nécessaires pour continuer d'offrir un maximum d'activités en présence, des programmes de haute qualité, une recherche dynamique et une expérience étudiante riche, dans le respect des mesures sociosanitaires en vigueur. Ces nouvelles modalités nous donneront une certaine souplesse, dans un contexte en constante évolution, afin de poursuivre le travail remarquable que nous avons accompli collectivement cet automne, pour lequel je veux chaudement vous féliciter.<br /><br /><br />Le recteur,<br />Pr Pierre Cossette  </p>

<p class="bodytext">Le Campus de Longueuil fait maintenant partie d'une zone rouge. Malgré ce changement, le ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur nous demande de poursuivre les activités d'enseignement en présentiel, telles qu'elles ont été planifiées. Ainsi, les activités pédagogiques, incluant notamment les laboratoires et les cliniques d'enseignement, se poursuivent sans modification. Les activités de recherche, et donc l'ensemble des activités dans les parcours d'études supérieures en recherche, sont aussi maintenues. La bibliothèque et le Centre sportif demeurent ouverts.

<p class="bodytext">Message à tous les membres du personnel,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Depuis le début de la pandémie, l'UdeS a adopté la ligne directrice de tenir un maximum d'activités en présentiel pour le plus grand nombre possible d'étudiantes et d'étudiants, tout en se conformant de façon méticuleuse aux directives de la Santé publique.

Des personnes ont contracté la COVID-19 à l'extérieur, dans une variété de circonstances, et le recul que nous avons permet de confirmer que le travail et les études sur nos campus sont sécuritaires. Les relevés à cet effet sont divulgués sur une base hebdomadaire. Il nous faut bien sûr poursuivre nos efforts de respect des consignes sanitaires de façon rigoureuse, considérant le contexte épidémiologique actuel.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Le Campus de Longueuil fait maintenant partie d'une zone rouge. Malgré ce changement, le ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur nous demande de poursuivre les activités d'enseignement en présentiel telles qu'elles ont été planifiées. Toutes les prestations de travail reliées directement aux activités académiques programmées, incluant notamment les laboratoires et les cliniques d'enseignement, se poursuivront donc sans modification. La bibliothèque demeurera ouverte, en cohérence avec cette orientation. La direction universitaire est heureuse de constater la priorité accordée à l'éducation et à l'enseignement supérieur par le gouvernement.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Toutefois, considérant que la désignation de zone rouge de la grande région de Montréal inclut notre Campus de Longueuil, nous allons y encourager le télétravail dans les autres activités pour lesquelles cela est possible. Cette décision de la direction universitaire vise à collaborer à l'effort collectif de réduction des déplacements dans les zones critiques, tout en préservant sur place les prestations prioritaires. Cette décision sera revue en fonction de l'évolution de la situation sociosanitaire. Par ailleurs, conformément aux directives de la Santé publique, les commerces et le Centre sportif resteront ouverts, alors que les restaurants ne pourront plus servir en salle. Cela s'appliquera à compter de 00&nbsp;h&nbsp;01, ce jeudi 1<sup>er</sup>&nbsp;octobre.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Le Campus principal et le Campus de la santé sont maintenant en zone orange, mais cela n'entraine aucun changement dans nos activités. Les déplacements interrégionaux ne sont pas recommandés, sauf pour les activités de travail et d'études. Les activités de stages sont maintenues, en cohérence avec les consignes sanitaires des milieux de travail.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous espérons que cette période de 28&nbsp;jours annoncée par le gouvernement du Québec positionnera l'ensemble de la province à des niveaux de transmission communautaire comparables à ceux du début du trimestre. Si c'est le cas, nous aurons réussi à traverser cette deuxième vague en maintenant au maximum nos capacités d'accomplir pleinement notre mission.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mais peu importe comment la situation sanitaire du Québec évoluera, nous pouvons déjà toutes et tous être fiers de nous et du travail accompli.</p>

Les chiffres pourront être consultés sur le  <a href="../index.html" target="_blank">site Coronavirus</a>, et seront mis à jour sur une base hebdomadaire.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Depuis la reprise des activités de recherche et d’enseignement en mai  dernier, c’est avec attention et minutie que nous prenons soin de gérer  toute situation susceptible d’avoir un impact sur la sécurité et la  santé de toutes et tous. D’ailleurs, aucune éclosion n’est survenue sur  nos campus, incluant la période écoulée depuis la rentrée de l’automne,  ce qui tend à confirmer l’efficacité de nos mesures en place.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous vous rappelons que tous les gens qui pourraient avoir eu <a href="../faq/symptomes-absence-et-mise-en-isolement/index.html#c316922-6" title="Ouvre un lien interne dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">des contacts significatifs </a>avec un cas de COVID-19 confirmé recevront un appel téléphonique directement de la part de la Santé publique, s'ils présentent <a href="../faq/symptomes-absence-et-mise-en-isolement/index.html#c316922-7" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">un risque de transmission modéré ou élevé</a>.

Compte tenu de la  complexité des enquêtes épidémiologiques, les cas requérant un isolement  nous sont rapportés par la Santé publique dans les 24 à 36 h suivant  les résultats des tests. Si vous ne recevez pas de communication, vous  n'avez pas à vous inquiéter.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous tenons à vous remercier pour votre participation à la réussite des mécanismes mis en place, notamment le recours au <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/coronavirus/symptomes-et-precautions/formulaire-de-declaration-covid-19/">formulaire de déclaration de COVID-19 en ligne</a>,  qui contribue grandement à assurer un environnement sécuritaire à  l’ensemble de la communauté universitaire. De plus, sachant que la  totalité des cas déclarés à l’UdeS est issue d’activités se déroulant à  l’extérieur des campus, nous vous encourageons à persister dans le  respect et la promotion des consignes sociosanitaires, peu importe où  vous vous trouvez. C’est en prenant au sérieux notre responsabilité  individuelle que nous pourrons assurer le bien-être de toutes et tous.</p>

			<h2 class="accordeon">15 septembre 2020 - 10 h 25&nbsp;: Gestion des cas déclarés de COVID-19 sur nos campus</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Bonjour,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Notre rentrée universitaire s'est déroulée avec succès sur nos campus, et le trimestre d'automne est maintenant bien amorcé pour nos étudiantes et étudiants.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Dans le contexte particulier que nous traversons, comme il est inévitable que des déclarations de cas de COVID-19 surviennent au sein de notre communauté, nous souhaitons rappeler les grandes lignes du protocole de gestion de ces cas, qui découle des directives sociosanitaires gouvernementales en place.</p>

Les personnes étudiantes doivent aviser au préalable leur secrétaire de faculté<sup>1</sup>, et les membres du personnel doivent faire de même auprès des personnes supérieures immédiates. L'information consignée au formulaire est très utile pour la Santé publique, qui s'assure en toute confidentialité de mener à bien les démarches et enquêtes nécessaires.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Seuls les gens qui pourraient avoir eu des contacts significatifs avec un cas de COVID-19 confirmé recevront un appel téléphonique de la part de la Santé publique, s'ils présentent un risque de transmission modéré ou élevé<sup>2</sup>. Un dépistage en cas de symptômes sera alors requis, de même qu'un isolement préventif de 14 jours. Dans le cas des personnes qui auraient eu un contact à risque faible<sup>3</sup>, elles recevront un avis par courrier électronique. Si vous ne recevez pas de communication, c'est que vous ne présentez pas de risques, et que vous n'avez pas à vous inquiéter.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Les résultats positifs de dépistage de la COVID-19 s'obtiennent 24 à 48 heures après avoir subi un test. Il est à noter qu'il est nécessaire de remplir à nouveau le&nbsp;<a href="../symptomes-et-consignes/formulaire-de-declaration-covid-19/index.html" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_top" class="internal-link"><span class="list-item-num"></span><b>formulaire de déclaration</b><span class="list-item-num">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></a> à la suite de l'obtention d'un résultat, qu'il soit négatif ou positif.</p>
<p class="bodytext">À moins d'une indication contraire de la Santé publique, les personnes qui ne ressentent pas de symptômes particuliers n'ont pas à se rendre à un centre de dépistage, dont les services sont offerts en priorité aux cas symptomatiques.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Pour plus d'information, consultez la&nbsp;<a href="../faq/index.html" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_top" class="internal-link"><span class="list-item-num"></span><b>FAQ</b></a> et le&nbsp;<span class="list-item-num"></span><a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/coronavirus/fileadmin/sites/coronavirus/documents/Schema_vf.pdf" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" class="download"><b>schéma détaillé</b><span class="list-item-num">&nbsp;</span></a> portant spécifiquement sur ce sujet, sur le site Coronavirus.</p>

			<h2 class="accordeonClosed accordeon">27 août 2020 - 18 h&nbsp;: Pour une rentrée responsable, centrée sur votre réussite!&nbsp; </h2>
<p class="bodytext">Bonjour,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Je suis heureuse de vous voir enfin sur nos campus. Je vous souhaite la bienvenue.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Vous le savez, cette année, nous devons faire les choses autrement. Votre réussite a été au cœur de toutes nos décisions en cette rentrée 2020. Ainsi, nous avons choisi de tenir toutes les activités d'intégration en mode virtuel. Cette décision vise à protéger toute notre communauté en évitant la transmission de la COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Comme citoyenne et citoyen, vous devez aussi respecter l’ensemble des consignes sociosanitaires du Gouvernement du Québec, peu importe où vous vous trouvez. Ainsi, réfléchissez bien avant de décider de participer à des activités en dehors du campus qui ne respectent pas les mesures sociosanitaires, et ce peu importe la taille prévue du groupe.</p>
<p class="bodytext">La dernière chose que nous souhaitons, c'est de vous voir obligés de subir une quarantaine ou pire la maladie, ce qui pourrait nuire à votre réussite et à celle de vos consœurs et confrères. Une éclosion pourrait compromettre la tenue des activités pédagogiques en présentiel. Tous conviennent que ce serait très lourd de conséquences pour vous et vos collègues.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Je compte sur votre compréhension et votre respect des mesures sociosanitaires comme le font des millions de Québécoises et de Québécois.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Bonne rentrée!&nbsp;</p>

De plus, des espaces de vie sont en cours d'installation afin de permettre une vie de campus dans un contexte le plus agréable possible.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Au trimestre d’hiver, plusieurs mesures ont été mises en place par la direction de l’Université de Sherbrooke afin de soutenir les membres de la communauté étudiante aux prises avec des difficultés financières. Afin de réitérer son appui aux étudiantes et étudiants, l’Université prolonge jusqu’au 19 septembre 2020 la suspension de la facturation de frais d'intérêts pour les soldes impayés de frais de scolarité. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous espérons que ce sursis permettra d’alléger, en partie, le fardeau financier des étudiantes et étudiants qui se retrouvent dans une situation précaire en raison du contexte actuel. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Les membres de la communauté étudiante qui éprouvent des difficultés sur le plan financier ou qui ont un compte en souffrance sont invités à prendre entente avec le Service des ressources financières pour le paiement de leurs frais de scolarité. Pour en savoir plus sur les mesures d’aide financière possible, notamment sur le recours au Fonds d'aide d'urgence créé par l’Université, ou aux différentes mesures gouvernementales, consultez les <a href="../faq/ressources-pour-les-personnes-etudiantes/index.html#c300635-4">Ressources pour les personnes étudiantes</a> du site USherbrooke/coronavirus.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="bodytext"><i>Message à la communauté universitaire</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">Bonjour,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Dans un courriel envoyé au personnel le 9 juillet dernier, nous faisions connaître notre décision de rendre le port du couvre-visage obligatoire dans certains de nos espaces à partir du 10 août. Or le gouvernement provincial a annoncé, le 13 juillet, que cette précaution serait en vigueur dans tous les lieux publics intérieurs dès le 18 juillet.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Dans le souci de se conformer aux règles sociosanitaires gouvernementales, l'UdeS a décidé de s'aligner sur la date annoncée par le premier ministre cette semaine, bien que plusieurs de nos espaces ne constituent pas des lieux publics.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Dès le samedi 18 juillet 2020</b>, le port du couvre-visage sera donc obligatoire pour tous les membres de la communauté universitaire, lors de leur entrée dans les bâtiments et de leurs déplacements dans les halls, couloirs et autres aires de circulation communes de l'UdeS. Le couvre-visage pourra être retiré une fois rendu «&nbsp;à destination&nbsp;» sur le lieu de travail ou d'étude, tel que mentionné lors de notre annonce initiale.</p>

<p class="bodytext"><i>Message au personnel</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">Bonjour,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Depuis le 22 juin, la plupart des membres du personnel de l'Université ainsi que nos équipes de recherche sont de retour en présentiel sur nos campus. Nous sommes fiers de constater à quel point la reprise des activités se déroule bien grâce à nos efforts à toutes et tous. Dans quelques semaines, des milliers d'étudiants arriveront sur nos campus et nous devons continuer de prendre toutes les précautions nécessaires pour consolider ce succès.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Aujourd'hui, nous déployons de nouvelles mesures dans notre plan de rétablissement des activités universitaires pour encore mieux nous préparer au retour d'un nombre significatif de personnes sur nos campus.</p><ul><li><b>Dès maintenant</b>, nous simplifions nos processus de suivi en éliminant les registres d'entrée et de sortie. Cette procédure sera remplacée par un formulaire institutionnel unique de déclaration Covid-19 destiné à toute personne présentant un ou des symptômes, ayant été en contact avec une personne infectée ou qui doit rester à la maison en raison d'ordonnances de la Direction de la santé publique. Toutes les personnes n'ayant aucune condition spéciale à déclarer n'auront plus d'obligation de remplir le registre à l'entrée et à la sortie du travail.

Le couvre visage pourra être retiré une fois rendu «à destination» sur le lieu de travail ou d'étude.

<p class="bodytext"><i>Message au personnel</i></p>
<p class="bodytext">Bonjour,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Depuis le 13 mars, la communauté de l'UdeS fait preuve d'une grande agilité et d'une solidarité exemplaires pour s'adapter à la situation créée par la pandémie de Covid-19. La bonne marche des activités de recherche et administratives qui reprennent sur nos campus nous démontre encore à quel point nous sommes capables, ensemble, de relever les plus grands défis. Ce succès nous permet maintenant de préciser les objectifs de retour graduel de la majorité du personnel pour l'ensemble des campus. La préparation du trimestre d'automne progresse de façon impressionnante, témoignant encore une fois de l'engagement et de la créativité de notre communauté.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous annonçons donc aujourd'hui des précisions importantes de notre <a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usherbrooke.ca%2Fbulletins%2Flien%2F9281%2Ff2b8583fe467c%2FaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudXNoZXJicm9va2UuY2EvY29yb25hdmlydXMvZmlsZWFkbWluL3NpdGVzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzL2RvY3VtZW50cy9yZXRhYmxpc3NlbWVudC9QbGFuX1JldGFibGlzc2VtZW50X1VkZVNfM19qdWluLnBkZg%3D%3D&amp;data=02%7C01%7CChantal.Roy4%40USherbrooke.ca%7C2844c54d51494a9fcdc808d807cbaa91%7C3a5a8744593545f99423b32c3a5de082%7C0%7C0%7C637267918609677649&amp;sdata=aCat%2BoY6xT9royd2DYd5IBGnggnzuqCz2nwWSl15Xww%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Plan de rétablissement</a>, dont les dates limites pour le retour en présentiel des membres du personnel qui sont en télétravail&nbsp;:</p><ul><li><b>Lundi 8 juin&nbsp;:</b>      tout le personnel d'encadrement des facultés et écoles, services, bureaux,      centres, instituts ou autres unités administratives, ainsi que d'autres      personnes qui pourraient être identifiées par les gestionnaires de chaque      unité;</li><li><b>Lundi 15 juin&nbsp;:</b>      tout personnel professionnel ou de soutien des facultés et écoles,      services, bureaux, centres, instituts ou autres unités administratives      requis pour la préparation des sessions d'enseignement;</li><li><b>Semaine du 22 juin&nbsp;:</b>      Retour en présentiel de tout le personnel des facultés et écoles,      services, bureaux, centres, instituts ou autres unités administratives      requis pour la reprise des sessions d'enseignement, le redémarrage des      activités sportives, culturelles, extracurriculaire, philanthropiques et      toute autre opération courante de l'Université, dans le respect des      mesures socio-sanitaires qui seront en vigueur à ce moment.</li></ul><p class="bodytext">Ce retour des membres du personnel en présentiel avant le début des vacances d'été est indispensable à l'appropriation et à la mise en pratique des mesures sociosanitaires en vue de la rentrée d'automne.

<p class="bodytext">Les équipes du Service des immeubles et tous les gestionnaires travaillent depuis quelques semaines pour faciliter la reprise des activités avec un maximum de sécurité et un minimum d'inconvénients.

<p class="bodytext">Nous avons aussi précisé certaines mesures générales concernant la distanciation physique&nbsp;sur les campus et des mesures supplémentaires pourraient s'appliquer dans certaines unités, selon les besoins rencontrés.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous vous invitons à prendre connaissance de toutes les autres consignes et renseignements utiles à votre retour sur le site <a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usherbrooke.ca%2Fbulletins%2Flien%2F9281%2Ff2b8583fe467c%2FaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudXNoZXJicm9va2UuY2EvY29yb25hdmlydXMvcmV0YWJsaXNzZW1lbnQtZGVzLWFjdGl2aXRlcy8%3D&amp;data=02%7C01%7CChantal.Roy4%40USherbrooke.ca%7C2844c54d51494a9fcdc808d807cbaa91%7C3a5a8744593545f99423b32c3a5de082%7C0%7C0%7C637267918609687642&amp;sdata=XNWITdREYdjlTm4m1U7S4aK75yuZ77QNNP%2F57fagA2o%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"><b>Coronavirus</b></a>.

<p class="bodytext">Pour la rentrée d'automne, notre objectif est clair&nbsp;: permettre au plus grand nombre possible d'étudiantes et d'étudiants de faire un maximum d'activités et d'expériences en présence, car nous savons que la vie de campus et les interactions humaines sont importantes dans un parcours universitaire pour développer son plein potentiel, confronter ses idées à celles des autres et façonner son identité professionnelle.&nbsp; Bien sûr, nous sommes préoccupés par la sécurité de toute notre communauté universitaire. Nous intègrerons donc les éléments sociosanitaires devenus incontournables aux expériences de formation et de recherche.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Comme vous le savez probablement, dans les dernières semaines, nous avons travaillé à relancer nos activités de recherche, notamment celles qui nécessitent une présence en laboratoire ou sur le terrain. Les gestionnaires sont aussi revenus en grand nombre. Nous sommes heureux de vous informer que cette première étape se passe très bien, et que nos campus sont de plus en plus animés.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nos équipes poursuivent leur retour progressif et s'affairent à l'organisation d'une rentrée sécuritaire et riche d'activités pour l'automne. Nous devons bien sûr moduler nos décisions en fonction d'une situation qui évolue constamment, mais présentement, nous déployons tous les efforts nécessaires pour vous offrir une session de qualité, bien organisée, dans une formule d'enseignement qui combinera différents types d'activités sur place et à distance. Il appartient à chaque programme et à chaque faculté et centre universitaire de formation de déterminer la combinaison optimale. Certaines activités pédagogiques se donneront complètement en présence et d'autres à distance, mais il pourra par exemple y avoir certaines parties d'un cours qui se dérouleront en classe, et d'autres en mode virtuel. L'essentiel pour nous, c'est de miser sur une programmation académique pertinente et de qualité, peu importe sa modalité.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Concrètement, en plus de l'organisation pédagogique exceptionnelle, nos équipes vont s'affairer cet été à aménager nos espaces pour tenir compte des éléments de distanciation sociale et des autres normes sanitaires nécessaires. Bien entendu, nos scénarios devront s'adapter aux réalités de nos différents campus. Ils pourront aussi évoluer en fonction du contexte et des directives de la santé publique. Le coronavirus risque de faire partie de notre vie pour une période prolongée. Nous devons apprendre à fonctionner avec cette réalité, en assurant notre sécurité à toutes et à tous.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous vous encourageons, vous aussi, à préparer votre rentrée d'automne en complétant vos démarches avec la même vision que nous&nbsp;: une vraie rentrée sur nos campus. Nous avons très hâte de vous accueillir toutes et tous en personne. Votre présence est au cœur de notre raison d'être.&nbsp;</p>

			<h2 class="accordeon">21 mai 2020 - 9 h 55&nbsp;:&nbsp;Nouvelle étape du plan de rétablissement de l’UdeS</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Bonjour à toutes et à tous, </p>
<p class="bodytext">Dans les dernières semaines, nous avons travaillé à relancer nos activités de recherche, notamment celles qui nécessitent une présence en laboratoire ou sur le terrain, dans le respect des directives sociosanitaires. Les gestionnaires sont aussi revenus en grand nombre. Nous sommes heureux de vous informer que cette première étape se déroule très bien et que la vie reprend graduellement sur nos campus. Nous avons également redémarré nos nombreux chantiers de construction ainsi que certains travaux d'aménagement extérieur. </p>
<p class="bodytext">La nouvelle étape qui s'amorce maintenant est celle de votre retour progressif. Cette étape est essentielle pour préparer l'arrivée sur les campus de nos étudiantes et étudiants au trimestre d'automne. Cette rentrée représente un défi de grande envergure. Apprivoiser la vie et le travail dans nos espaces, dans le respect des normes sanitaires, est incontournable pour y arriver. En parallèle, nous pourrons aussi accompagner le redémarrage d'autres activités autorisées par le déconfinement progressif coordonné par le gouvernement. L'ouverture des bibliothèques et de certains laboratoires d'enseignement en sont quelques exemples. Ce travail d'apprivoisement et d'organisation prend du temps et de l'entraînement. Il doit être instauré progressivement, en présence d'un nombre croissant de personnes. Par conséquent, les directions des facultés, des centres universitaires de formation et des services de l'Université organisent votre retour prévu au cours des prochaines semaines et durant le mois juin. Les gestionnaires de vos unités communiqueront sous peu avec vous à cet effet. </p>
<p class="bodytext">La persévérance et la réussite étudiante sont au cœur de notre mission. Or, la vie de campus et les interactions humaines en présence sont importantes dans un parcours universitaire, autant pour confronter ses idées à celles des autres que pour façonner son identité professionnelle.&nbsp; Dans ces circonstances hors de l'ordinaire, nous avons la responsabilité de former les étudiantes et étudiants pour qu'ils puissent développer leur plein potentiel et contribuer à la société en professionnels efficaces et capables de travailler en contexte réel, dès la fin de leurs études. L'UdeS continue ainsi à s'adapter aux imprévus, à innover et à trouver des solutions en réponse aux besoins actuels et futurs de notre société. En misant sur une session d'automne en présentiel, les personnes diplômées de nos programmes auront appris à composer avec des contraintes supplémentaires, celles de la Covid-19 qui changent nos façons d'étudier, de travailler et de socialiser. Évidemment, nos scénarios devront s'adapter aux réalités de nos différents campus et aux caractéristiques des différents programmes. Ils feront l'objet d'ajustements en fonction du contexte et des directives de la santé publique. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Bien sûr, nous sommes préoccupés par la sécurité de toute notre communauté universitaire. Nous intègrerons les éléments sociosanitaires devenus incontournables à nos modes de fonctionnement et aux expériences de formation et de recherche de nos étudiantes et étudiants. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Nos équipes s'affairent à aménager les différents espaces pour tenir compte des éléments de distanciation physique et des autres normes sanitaires nécessaires. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous avons très hâte de vous revoir toutes et tous en personne. Votre présence est essentielle non seulement à la bonne marche de nos activités, mais aussi à l'ambiance unique de nos campus. Le coronavirus risque de faire partie de notre vie pour une période prolongée. Nous devons apprendre à fonctionner avec cette réalité, en assurant notre sécurité à toutes et à tous.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="bodytext">Pour connaître le détail des mesures qui sont prises par l'Université, je vous invite à consulter le Plan de rétablissement institutionnel sur le site Coronavirus et à prendre connaissance du <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/srh/covid-19/guide-retour-travail-personnel/" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">Guide de retour au travail des membres du personnel - COVID-19</a> </p>
<p class="bodytext">Je vous remercie de votre importante contribution et de votre engagement à faire de la relance de nos activités en présentiel un succès que nous serons fiers d'avoir relevé ensemble. </p>

<p class="bodytext">Bonjour,</p>
<p class="bodytext">Tandis que s’opère la relance progressive et sécuritaire des activités de recherche en présentiel, l’Université planifie la reprise graduelle des activités administratives sur ses campus et prépare la rentrée du trimestre d’automne 2020.<br /><br />À cet effet, nous annonçons que nous prévoyons la tenue d’activités pédagogiques en présentiel au trimestre d’automne. Nous voulons permettre au plus grand nombre possible d’étudiantes et d’étudiants de faire un maximum d’activités et d’expériences en présence sur nos campus. Les activités pédagogiques pourront se faire selon une approche hybride, combinant séances en présence et séances à distance, en empruntant des formes et des modalités diverses. Celles-ci s’appuieront sur les forces de notre université tout en respectant les directives de santé publique et les consignes sociosanitaires gouvernementales, telles qu’elles s’appliqueront à l’automne.<span class="list-item-num">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />L’UdeS a construit son excellente réputation sur ses formations pratiques et innovantes, la convivialité de ses interactions humaines, la qualité de son environnement et sa vie de campus. Grâce à ces caractéristiques, elle affiche un taux de diplomation supérieur à la moyenne de l’ensemble des universités québécoises dans ses programmes de baccalauréat. C’est aussi en raison de ces traits distinctifs que de nombreux étudiants et étudiantes choisissent chaque année l’UdeS, et que les personnes diplômées manifestent leur fierté d’appartenir à sa grande communauté. Ces éléments sont au cœur de ce que nous sommes et de la «&nbsp;différence UdeS&nbsp;».<span class="list-item-num">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Nous comprenons que la reprise d’activités en présence est aussi un ingrédient important pour favoriser la réussite étudiante, surtout dans les programmes de formation initiale. Elle nécessitera une planification serrée, réalisée à l’échelle des programmes et de chaque activité pédagogique, selon les caractéristiques propres aux différents campus et selon le profil de la population étudiante concernée. Cette planification visera à tirer le meilleur parti possible du temps en présence pour atteindre les objectifs d’apprentissage, maintenir l’engagement et soutenir la persévérance étudiante.

Des mesures seront également mises en place pour proposer et partager les bonnes idées et les meilleures pratiques développées par les membres du personnel enseignant, professionnel et de soutien. Plus de renseignements sur ces ressources et les mesures déployées pour bien préparer le trimestre d’automne seront communiqués prochainement.<span class="list-item-num">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Depuis plusieurs semaines, la communauté de l’UdeS démontre une agilité, une créativité et une solidarité exemplaires pour s’adapter à la situation créée par la pandémie.

Dans ce contexte tout à fait inédit, une multitude d’initiatives ont vu le jour pour continuer d’offrir une formation de qualité, appuyer la réussite étudiante, éclairer le débat public et créer des espaces d’échanges stimulants, rassurants et sécuritaires. Afin de relever les défis qui se présentent, nous continuerons collectivement à innover.

<p class="bodytext">À l'instar du gouvernement, qui évoque chaque jour des scénarios de relance, l'Université de Sherbrooke planifie et organise actuellement le rétablissement progressif de certaines de ses activités. La première étape de cette planification prévoit la relance de toutes les activités de recherche qui peuvent se tenir dans le respect des mesures sociosanitaires émises par les autorités. Nous mettons tout en œuvre pour être prêts pour le lancement de ce rétablissement le 4 mai prochain, dans l'éventualité où le gouvernement donnerait le feu vert pour cette date.</p>
<p class="bodytext">La relance des activités de recherche universitaire demeure primordiale pour que nous puissions, comme institution, remplir pleinement notre rôle dans la société et apporter des solutions aux défis, qu'ils remontent à l'avant-crise ou qu'ils découlent de la situation actuelle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Des mesures de sécurité particulières seront prises pour protéger les personnes qui seront appelées à revenir sur les campus. Parmi ces mesures, nommons un entretien sanitaire accru des espaces communs, le respect de la distance de deux mètres entre les personnes et le lavage des mains fréquent. Les personnes concernées seront avisées par leur unité du moment prévu pour leur retour. Chaque unité déterminera les mesures appropriées à son environnement de travail spécifique, en fonction des consignes applicables émises par les autorités compétentes.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Toute reprise est conditionnelle à l'aval des instances gouvernementales. Elle se fera, par activités prioritaires, dans le respect des différentes réalités de recherche et des individus.</p>

<h2 class="accordeon">9 avril 2020 - 12 h 35&nbsp;: Félicitations au personnel de l'Université de Sherbrooke</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Tout le conseil d'administration se joint à moi pour féliciter chaleureusement la direction, l'ensemble du personnel et les instances syndicales et associatives de l'Université de Sherbrooke pour le gigantesque travail réalisé récemment afin de soutenir la réussite des étudiantes et des étudiants. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous vivons des moments hors du commun qui affectent la vie d'une multitude de gens, notamment celle des personnes apprenantes qui voient leur contexte d'études perturbé. Le Québec aura pourtant encore davantage besoin de talents et de diplômées et de diplômés au lendemain de cette pandémie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Le conseil d'administration tient à manifester son appui à tous les efforts qui sont déployés quotidiennement pour réaliser la mission de l'UdeS. Nous reconnaissons les valeurs d'humanisme et d'excellence caractéristiques de la communauté universitaire qui a encore une fois fait la démonstration de son sens de l'innovation et de son agilité exemplaire. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Merci pour votre engagement, votre dévouement et votre travail assidu dans des circonstances difficiles. La solidarité et l'entraide dont vous faites preuve nous permettront de relever les défis actuels.</p>

			<h2 class="accordeon">3 avril 2020&nbsp;: Recherche et études supérieures&nbsp;: Plan de soutien pour le secteur de la recherche</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Le plan de soutien pour le secteur de la recherche commence à prendre forme. Le mot d'ordre des directions des principaux organismes subventionnaires (CRSH, CRSNG, IRSC et FRQ) est «&nbsp;qu'ils seront là pour soutenir les chercheuses et chercheurs&nbsp;». Leurs plans de soutien (ex&nbsp;: extension et prolongation de subventions de fonctionnement, report et annulation de concours, etc.) sont en élaboration ou déjà soumis à leurs conseils d'administration ou aux autorités gouvernementales. Les annonces devraient suivre sous peu.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Il est important d'être solidaire et d'épauler vos équipes de recherche. Dans ce contexte, et confiante que les plans de soutien seront au rendez-vous, la direction de l'Université a pris la décision de garantir le salaire du personnel de recherche régulier pour la période du mois d'avril. Cette mesure vise à assurer le salaire du personnel déjà rémunéré à partir de subventions et contrats de recherche (APAPUS, SEESUS, stagiaires postdoctoraux, étudiantes et étudiants). Les modalités de ce plan de soutien institutionnel seront annoncées très bientôt. Il est important de souligner que ces mesures exceptionnelles seront appliquées en complément aux plans de soutien des organismes subventionnaires. Les professeures et professeurs devront prioritairement utiliser les plans de soutien des organismes pour combler les pertes engendrées par les mesures de confinement en lien avec la COVID-19.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Entretemps, nous invitons toute la communauté à profiter de cette période pour continuer à faire preuve de créativité et d'ingéniosité. Nous vous rappelons notre invitation à saisir cette occasion pour gagner du temps en favorisant les travaux réalisables à distance tel que les revues bibliographiques, la rédaction de nouvelles demandes de subvention, la préparation d'examens généraux, la rédaction d'articles et de chapitres de livres, et, en particulier pour les étudiantes et étudiants, la rédaction d'essais, de mémoires et de thèses.</p>
<p class="bodytext">En cette période pour le moins atypique, professeures et professeurs, nous avons la certitude que nous parviendrons, ensemble, à traverser la crise tout en favorisant l'avancement de la recherche.</p>

			<h2 class="accordeon">27 mars 2020 - 17&nbsp;h 55&nbsp;: Nouvelles modalités d’évaluation à l’Université de Sherbrooke pour protéger la moyenne cumulative des personnes étudiantes</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Les personnes étudiantes inscrites à des activités pédagogiques à l’Université de Sherbrooke au cours du trimestre d’hiver&nbsp;2020 pourront se prévaloir d’un choix de barème de notation qui n’aura pas d’effet négatif sur leur moyenne cumulative.</p>
<p class="bodytext">L’Université de Sherbrooke se préoccupe avant tout de la réussite de ses étudiantes et de ses étudiants. Elle a notamment mis en place un fonds d’aide d’urgence et elle a déployé des mesures de soutien psychologique.</p>
<p class="bodytext">«&nbsp;Grâce à la collaboration exceptionnelle de tout son personnel, notamment le personnel enseignant, et des partenaires syndicaux, l’UdeS a rapidement adopté des mesures alternatives pour la poursuite des activités pédagogiques&nbsp;», explique la vice-rectrice aux études, professeure Christine Hudon. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Toutefois, certaines personnes étudiantes ont des craintes pour le maintien de leur niveau de performance académique habituel. Pour pallier cette situation, de nombreuses universités québécoises, canadiennes et américaines ont choisi de modifier leur barème de notation. «&nbsp;Avec le même objectif, le comité de direction de l’Université de Sherbrooke a adopté des mesures d’exception afin d’éviter tout préjudice à ses personnes étudiantes qui pourraient éventuellement demander une admission dans une autre université ou encore une bourse universitaire ou d’un organisme subventionnaire&nbsp;», ajoute-t-elle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ainsi, une étudiante ou un étudiant qui n’est pas satisfait de la note attribuée à la fin d’une activité pédagogique aura deux options. La personne pourra se prévaloir de la possibilité de conserver le barème de notation prévu au plan d’activité pédagogique. Elle pourra également avoir recours au barème de notation «&nbsp;Réussite ou Échec&nbsp;» exprimé au relevé de notes par les mentions «&nbsp;R&nbsp;» et «&nbsp;E&nbsp;». Il sera également possible de changer un «&nbsp;Échec&nbsp;» pour un «&nbsp;Abandon&nbsp;» ou «&nbsp;AB&nbsp;». La note «&nbsp;R&nbsp;» et la note «&nbsp;AB&nbsp;» n’ont pas d’effet sur la moyenne cumulative. Cette mesure ne s’applique cependant pas aux activités terminées avant le 13&nbsp;mars.</p>
<p class="bodytext">La personne étudiante qui souhaite opter pour le barème de notation «&nbsp;Réussite ou Échec&nbsp;» doit signifier son choix à la direction de son programme d’études avant le 15&nbsp;juin 2020, selon les modalités déterminées par la faculté ou le centre universitaire de formation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Des précisions sur l’application de ces mesures seront communiquées aux personnes étudiantes par les facultés et centres de formation. L’Université de Sherbrooke invite sa communauté à consulter régulièrement le site <a href="../index.html" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">USherbrooke.ca/coronavirus</a> et particulièrement sa FAQ qui est mise à jour en continu.</p>

			<h2 class="accordeon">25 mars 2020 - 17 h 25&nbsp;: Gestion du travail au temps de la COVID-19&nbsp;: Mesures applicables à l'UdeS à compter du 25&nbsp;mars&nbsp;2020</h2>
<p class="bodytext">La direction de l’Université a adopté les actions ci-dessous pour la période de temps où l'Université est fermée aux activités en présentiel à la demande du gouvernement.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Activités pédagogiques</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Les activités pédagogiques de l’hiver 2020 sont maintenant bien lancées en mode alternatif d’apprentissage, allant de l’enseignement en ligne, synchrone ou asynchrone, jusqu’aux classes inversées virtuelles, en passant par des lectures dirigées. Considérant les annonces déjà connues, qui stipulent que les campus seront fermés au moins jusqu’au 1<sup>er&nbsp;</sup>mai, et l’évolution de la situation sociosanitaire actuelle, nous confirmons que les activités du trimestre d’été devront aussi être démarrées de la même manière, c’est-à-dire en mode alternatif d’apprentissage.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Le personnel enseignant est invité à préparer sa prestation en envisageant que tout le trimestre pourrait éventuellement être mené de cette façon, même si nous espérons pouvoir reprendre des activités en présentiel en cours de trimestre, en fonction de l’évolution des consignes gouvernementales. Lorsque des activités en présentiel pourront être réalisées, il appartiendra à chaque faculté et programme de déterminer comment il est opportun de revenir en partie ou en totalité aux modalités en présentiel au cours de la session d’été. Le personnel enseignant est invité à consulter le site <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/enseigner/alternatives-au-presentiel" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">Enseigner à l’UdeS</a> pour mettre en œuvre les modalités de rechange au présentiel.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Activités de recherche</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Le financement de la recherche impliquant plus de partenaires que celui de l’enseignement, plusieurs éléments doivent être convenus avec les principaux organismes subventionnaires. Les discussions sont très constructives jusqu’à maintenant, et la direction prendra les mesures requises pour que l’UdeS maintienne ses capacités de recherche et puisse redémarrer ses travaux dès que possible, et ce, dans les meilleures conditions.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Activités administratives</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Toutes les activités administratives et de soutien dans les services et les facultés sont en révision pour être effectuées en télétravail ou, dans certains cas, en présence.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Lignes directrices pour l’ensemble du personnel</b></p><ol><li>Les employés réguliers sont invités à faire du télétravail et doivent rester disponibles dans une proportion raisonnable pour leurs activités professionnelles. Dans un tel cas, l'employé est rémunéré comme s'il était au travail de façon régulière.</li><li>L’employé qui désire soustraire des journées ou demi-journées fixes durant la période actuelle peut, s’il le désire, utiliser ses banques de vacances ou de temps ou prendre des congés sans solde.&nbsp;</li><li>L'employé régulier qui ne peut pas donner une prestation régulière de travail en raison d’une situation familiale peut recevoir une allocation pour soins d’urgence (gouvernement fédéral).&nbsp;</li><li>Les gestionnaires qui ont des employés réguliers pour lesquels aucun travail à distance n’est possible seront appelés à communiquer la liste des noms de ces personnes au Service des ressources humaines dans le but de constituer une banque d’employés en disponibilité. Cette banque sera utilisée, le cas échéant, pour des besoins nouveaux ou des manques de ressources dans certains secteurs.</li><li>L'employé temporaire autre qu’un employé de la recherche (remplacement d'absence, surcroît de travail, contrat spécifique, etc.) est traité de la même façon qu'un employé régulier. Si le besoin n'existe plus et que l'employé ne peut pas être affecté à d'autres tâches pour lesquelles il serait qualifié, le supérieur immédiat peut mettre fin au contrat. Dans tous les cas, la décision de mettre fin à un contrat doit être entérinée par la faculté ou le service.&nbsp;</li><li>L'employé payé par le biais de fonds de recherche est normalement rémunéré comme s'il donnait sa prestation habituelle de travail. S'il ne peut exercer son travail à temps complet, il peut être affecté à d'autres tâches compatibles avec ses compétences (exemples&nbsp;: revue bibliographique, rédaction de rapports, analyse de données, aide à l’enseignement à distance). Si le besoin n'existe plus et que l'employé ne peut être affecté à d'autres tâches pour lesquelles il serait qualifié, le gestionnaire peut mettre fin au contrat. Si la fin du contrat était déjà prévue, celle-ci peut être effectuée. Dans tous les cas, la décision de mettre fin au contrat doit être entérinée par la faculté.&nbsp;</li><li>La situation de l'employé occasionnel, qui effectue des tâches spécifiques en fonction d'une prestation pour une période déterminée, est évaluée au cas par cas par son supérieur immédiat. S'il doit effectuer les tâches prévues à son contrat, ce dernier peut être reconduit. Si l’employé peut être affecté à d'autres tâches, une nouvelle demande de rémunération est faite pour ce nouveau travail. Sinon, son contrat prend fin jusqu'à ce que la situation soit revenue à la normale.&nbsp;</li><li>Les employés qui travaillent sur les lieux appartenant à l'Université pendant la période de fermeture sont rémunérés à taux régulier.</li><li>Si un employé doit encourir des dépenses exceptionnelles pour son télétravail, celles-ci peuvent être remboursées, à la condition qu'elles aient été approuvées au préalable par son supérieur immédiat.</li><li>Il n'y a aucun report de date de retraite.</li><li>L'assurance collective est traitée en conformité avec le contrat de notre assureur.</li><li>Le Service des ressources humaines est mandaté pour convenir avec les partenaires syndicaux d’ajustements à certains articles des conventions collectives afin, par exemple, de reporter les vacances et les banques associées, de surseoir aux périodes de probation et d’essai, de limiter les mouvements internes et de suspendre certains autres délais prescrits en temps normal. Il est également mandaté pour mettre en place les processus administratifs permettant d'actualiser les présentes mesures.&nbsp;</li></ol><p class="bodytext">Les membres du personnel sont invités à transmettre leurs questions et préoccupations à leur personne supérieure immédiate.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Les gestionnaires peuvent consulter la conseillère ou le conseiller en gestion des ressources humaines attitré à leur unité administrative.&nbsp;</p>

			<h2 class="accordeon">24 mars 2020 - 17 h&nbsp;:&nbsp;L'UdeS lance un fonds d'aide d'urgence pour les étudiantes et étudiants en difficultés financières</h2>
<p class="bodytext">Sensible aux enjeux financiers que peuvent vivre certains étudiants et étudiantes dans le contexte de la crise actuelle, l'Université de Sherbrooke annonce la création d'un fonds d'aide financière d'urgence pour pallier les besoins les plus criants. Un premier montant de 500&nbsp;000 $ a été consenti à ce fonds d'aide, ce qui constitue un geste très concret de l'institution pour démontrer son soutien.</p>
<p class="bodytext">«&nbsp;Plusieurs membres de notre communauté étudiante ont perdu l'emploi temporaire qui leur permettait de boucler leur budget. D'autres ont vu leur stage écourté ou annulé parce que l'employeur a dû fermer ses portes. Ils se retrouvent donc dans une situation financière précaire pouvant compromettre leurs études et il est important pour nous d'aider ces personnes dans le besoin&nbsp;», indique la professeure Jocelyne Faucher, vice-rectrice à la vie étudiante et secrétaire générale de l'Université.</p>
<p class="bodytext">La direction de l'Université est à définir les modalités précises pour le recours à ce nouveau fonds d'aide d'urgence. Des précisions seront annoncées d'ici vendredi le 27 mars en fin de journée, mais il apparaissait opportun d'annoncer dès à présent la création de ce fonds pour rassurer les membres de la communauté étudiante qui vivent une situation difficile sur le plan financier.</p>
<p class="bodytext">«&nbsp;Il est primordial pour nous que nos étudiantes et étudiants puissent poursuivre leurs études (en formation à distance) sans avoir à se demander s'ils pourront se nourrir ou payer leur loyer. En cette période hors du commun où plusieurs sont vulnérables, nous tenons à leur démontrer que nous sommes là pour eux&nbsp;», commente la vice-rectrice aux études, la professeure Christine Hudon. «&nbsp;Les étudiantes et étudiants inscrits dans des programmes d'études supérieures avec parcours de recherche pourront aussi faire appel à ce nouveau fonds d'aide&nbsp;», mentionne le vice-recteur à la recherche et aux études supérieures, le professeur Jean-Pierre Perreault.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Les étudiantes et étudiants qui souhaitent avoir recours à ce fonds d'aide d'urgence devront attendre au lundi 30 mars pour soumettre leurs questions et leurs demandes. Les informations seront accessibles à partir du site <a href="../index.html" target="_top" class="internal-link">USherbrooke.ca/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">D'autres mesures ont aussi été adoptées par la direction de l'Université pour soutenir les étudiantes et étudiants. Parmi celles-ci, il a été résolu de suspendre la facturation de frais d'intérêts pour les soldes impayés de frais de scolarité, et ce, jusqu'en août 2020. Cette mesure, d'une valeur de 180&nbsp;000 $, permettra aussi de soulager en partie la pression financière.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Depuis le début de cette crise, l'Université de Sherbrooke a démontré de plusieurs façons que la réussite étudiante reste au cœur de ses préoccupations malgré le contexte. La rapidité avec laquelle elle a déployé la formule de formation à distance, la mobilisation de tous les acteurs de l'institution et partenaires syndicaux ainsi que l'annonce aujourd'hui de ce fonds d'aide d'urgence n'en sont que quelques exemples.</p>

			<h2 class="accordeonOpened accordeon">23 mars 2020 - 18 h 45&nbsp;: Le point sur les nouvelles mesures de l'Université de Sherbrooke</h2>
<p class="bodytext">La direction de l’Université de Sherbrooke a adopté de nouvelles mesures à la lumière des consignes émises par le Gouvernement du Québec les 22 et 23 mars. Dans le contexte où l’Université est déjà fermée et que ses activités prioritaires se déroulaient déjà principalement à distance, tous les efforts requis sont déployés pour ne maintenir en présence que les services essentiels.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ainsi, les directions facultaires et de services ont réexaminé la liste de leurs services essentiels et activités prioritaires qui se poursuivront à distance.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Activités pédagogiques</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Les activités pédagogiques en présentiel sont toujours suspendues. Les formations déjà offertes à distance se poursuivront, par différentes modalités, pour atteindre les objectifs de formation de nos étudiantes et étudiants. Les facultés et directions de programmes continueront de travailler pour mettre en place les solutions encore nécessaires qui seront communiquées aux étudiantes et étudiants concernés.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Les stages coopératifs actuellement en cours se poursuivront selon les consignes émises dans les milieux de stage. Nous suggérons aux étudiantes et étudiants actuellement en stage de discuter avec leur employeur de la possibilité d’effectuer du télétravail. Comme mentionné, les étudiants dont le stage coopératif serait écourté par une décision de leur employeur verront leur stage reconnu.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Activités de recherche</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Les activités de recherche ont été interrompues, comme annoncé. Les cas exceptionnels qui nécessiteraient la présence en laboratoire devront obtenir une autorisation de la direction universitaire. L’Université est très impliquée dans l’élaboration de solutions pour la recherche et les études supérieures et comprend très bien la nature des enjeux soulevés par leur interruption, bien que, évidemment, les éléments socio-sanitaires et de santé publique doivent primer dans cette crise.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Le financement de la recherche impliquant plus de partenaires que celui de l’enseignement, plusieurs éléments doivent être convenus avec les principaux organismes subventionnaires. Les discussions sont très constructives jusqu’à maintenant, et la direction prendra les mesures requises pour que l’UdeS maintienne ses capacités de recherche et puisse redémarrer ses travaux dès que possible, et ce, dans les meilleures conditions.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Résidences</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Les étudiantes et étudiants aux résidences ont été invités à regagner leur domicile familial lorsque possible, ou à envisager des solutions alternatives. Celles et ceux qui demeurent dans les résidences doivent suivre des consignes strictes et les observer en tout temps.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Étudiants à l’international</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Quelque 200 étudiantes et étudiants effectuaient des études ou un stage à l’international. Le retour à la maison est déjà concrétisé ou organisé pour plus de 170 d’entre eux. Les autres se trouvent déjà dans leur pays d’origine ou ont choisi de ne pas être rapatriés au Québec.</p>
<p class="bodytext">L’Université invite sa communauté à consulter régulièrement le site&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/coronavirus" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_blank">USherbrooke.ca/coronavirus</a>&nbsp;et particulièrement sa FAQ qui est mise à jour en continu.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Dans ce contexte inédit, le recteur Pierre Cossette remercie chaleureusement chaque membre de la famille UdeS qui, depuis le début de cette crise, fait preuve d’un professionnalisme et d’une humanité exemplaires. L’Université continuera à s’adapter dans le respect des personnes et de leurs réalités. Toute la communauté est mobilisée autour de la réussite et du bien-être des étudiantes et étudiants.</p>

<p class="bodytext"><b>Sherbrooke, le 20 mars 2020&nbsp;</b>– La direction de l’Université de Sherbrooke ainsi que ses partenaires syndicaux remercient l’ensemble du personnel de l’Université d’avoir témoigné cette semaine sa grande solidarité avec nos étudiantes et nos étudiants en mettant leur réussite au&nbsp;coeur&nbsp;des actions que nous aurons à poser dans les prochaines semaines, voire dans les prochains mois.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">La mise en place progressive de moyens alternatifs au présentiel pour la poursuite de la session d’hiver est en route. Le télétravail s’implante graduellement, afin de soutenir le mieux possible notre mission, en particulier pour de nombreux placements en stages coopératifs et pour le soutien technologique à nos enseignantes et nos enseignants qui doivent revoir leurs façons de faire sur une très courte période de temps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">La session d’été qui débute le 27 avril nous demandera certainement de poursuivre ces efforts. Nous voulons que nos étudiantes et nos étudiants sachent que nous serons toujours là pour soutenir leur réussite. Les prochaines semaines demanderont à l’ensemble de la communauté universitaire, ouverture, créativité, adaptation et humanisme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous espérons aussi pouvoir redémarrer le plus tôt possible nos activités de recherche, dans le respect des normes sanitaires édictées par le gouvernement, car ces activités sont au&nbsp;coeur&nbsp;de la formation de nos étudiantes et nos étudiants aux deuxième et troisième cycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bodytext">Les facultés et directions de programmes communiqueront les dates précises aux étudiantes et étudiants une fois les nouvelles modalités d’enseignement établies pour les différentes activités pédagogiques.&nbsp;Par exemple, dans une situation où une personne étudiante dont le dernier examen d'un cours serait prévu le 23 avril, cette personne aurait jusqu’au 22 avril pour demander un abandon.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">Les étudiantes et étudiants qui auront abandonné leurs cours devront les reprendre ultérieurement&nbsp;ou&nbsp;les remplacer par d’autres selon ce qui est possible dans le programme.&nbsp; Il va sans dire que si les étudiantes et étudiants étaient inscrits à un cours obligatoire, cela ne les dégage pas de l’obligation de reprendre cette activité pédagogique pour répondre aux exigences de leur programme, à moins d’une permission spéciale du secrétaire de Faculté.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext">L’étudiante ou l’étudiant qui n’abandonne pas dans les délais peut, à l’instar de celle ou de celui qui ne complète pas les mesures de rattrapage, se voir attribuer la note W (échec par abandon) dans son relevé de notes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Dates de fin du trimestre d’hiver et de début du trimestre d’été 2020</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Les dates de début et de fin des trimestres inscrites aux calendriers universitaire et facultaires sont maintenues**. La date de fin du trimestre d'hiver 2020 est maintenue au 24 avril. La date de début du trimestre d'été 2020 demeure le 27 avril.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Mise à jour de la situation aux résidences</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Les étudiantes et étudiants actuellement aux résidences ont été invités à regagner leur domicile familial, lorsque possible, ou à envisager des solutions alternatives.&nbsp; Évidemment, personne n’est mis à la rue.

			<p class="bodytext">Dans le contexte où les universités sont fermées, la direction de l'Université, le Comité de coordination pour les mesures d'urgence (CCPMU) et toute la communauté universitaire se sont mobilisés pour trouver des solutions pour faire face aux enjeux posés par cette situation exceptionnelle.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous tenons dans un premier temps à vous assurer que nous respectons la totalité des consignes socio-sanitaires acheminées par le gouvernement du Québec. Nous vous invitons aussi à consulter régulièrement le site&nbsp;<span class="list-item-num"></span><a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/coronavirus" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">USherbrooke.ca/coronavirus</a> et particulièrement sa FAQ qui est mise à jour en continu. Vous serez ainsi informés en temps réel de l'état de la situation à l'UdeS et des plus récentes consignes à l'intention de la communauté universitaire.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>L'UdeS a déployé les mesures suivantes en réponse aux directives ministérielles&nbsp;:</b></p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Activités pédagogiques</b><br />Les activités pédagogiques en présentiel sont suspendues. Les efforts ont été déployés afin que des alternatives soient trouvées pour atteindre les objectifs de formation de nos étudiantes et étudiants. Les facultés et directions de programmes ont mis en place des solutions qui seront communiquées au fur et à mesure, notamment des modalités de formation à distance.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Les stages coopératifs actuellement en cours au sein des organismes et entreprises sont maintenus. Les stagiaires doivent respecter les consignes émises dans leur milieu de stage. À moins d'impossibilité, les stages prévus pour la session d'été auront lieu.</p>
<p class="bodytext">USherbrooke International met également en place des mesures pour faciliter le rapatriement des étudiantes et étudiants qui se trouvent en stage à l'étranger. Le personnel actuellement en déplacement à l'extérieur a également reçu la consigne de revenir au pays.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Activités de recherche</b><br />Les consignes émises vendredi dernier demeurent les mêmes. Dans un souci d'éthique et de sécurité, les expériences en cours nécessitant d'être complétées le seront. Les chercheuses et chercheurs ne doivent pas entreprendre de nouvelles expérimentations et concentrer leurs activités vers d'autres tâches liées à la recherche.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Autres activités</b><br />Malgré la fermeture des espaces publics sur nos campus, nous travaillons activement à des solutions pour répondre à l'ensemble des besoins des étudiantes et étudiants qui logent aux résidences.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous maintenons pour tous les étudiantes et étudiants la possibilité de recourir aux services de la clinique médicale, du Service de psychologie et d'orientation et du Service d'aide financière notamment. Les étudiantes et étudiants peuvent les joindre par courriel à l'adresse <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#118;&#101;&#64;&#85;&#83;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#98;&#114;&#111;&#111;&#107;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#97;">sve&#64;USherbrooke&#46;ca</a>.<span class="list-item-num">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Certains services alimentaires sont maintenus avec des modalités qui respectent les consignes socio-sanitaires qui s'appliquent.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Services administratifs</b><br />Les directions de toutes les facultés et des services ont identifié depuis vendredi les activités prioritaires qui doivent être maintenues au cours des prochaines semaines. Elles communiqueront directement et dans les meilleurs délais leurs décisions aux membres de leur personnel ou à leurs étudiantes et étudiants, le cas échéant.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Le Service des technologies de l'information et le Service des ressources humaines ont travaillé cette fin de semaine à mettre en place le fonctionnement pour permettre au plus grand nombre de personnes d'effectuer du télétravail. Les gestionnaires ont reçu ce matin des consignes à ce sujet. Nous réitérons que le télétravail est à privilégier dans toutes les situations où cela est possible.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous recommandons à toutes les personnes qui doivent poursuivre des activités sur nos campus de respecter l'ensemble des mesures préventives recommandées par les autorités, notamment&nbsp;:</p><ul><li>Se laver les mains fréquemment;</li><li>Maintenir une distanciation sociale sécuritaire (un mètre entre les individus);</li><li>S'isoler volontairement à la maison dès l'apparition de symptômes et consulter les services de santé appropriés.</li></ul><p class="bodytext">L'ensemble des mesures recommandées se trouvent sur le site <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/coronavirus" title="Ouvre un lien externe dans une nouvelle fenêtre" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">USherbrooke.ca/coronavirus</a>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nous invitons chaque membre de notre communauté à faire preuve de compréhension, de respect et d'ouverture envers les gens qui vivent actuellement des situations personnelles ou professionnelles difficiles.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Dans ce contexte inédit, je souhaite d'ailleurs remercier chaleureusement toutes les personnes qui travaillent sans relâche depuis vendredi à mettre en place les solutions qui, tout en assurant la sécurité de notre communauté, permettront la réussite de nos étudiantes et étudiants.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Je salue leur engagement et leur créativité.</p>

<p class="bodytext">L'Université Sherbrooke surveille attentivement la récente épidémie du nouveau coronavirus (2019-nCoV), qui a pris son essor à Wuhan, dans la province de Hubei, en Chine.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Risque</h4>
<p class="bodytext">L'Agence de santé publique du Canada a déterminé que le risque de santé publique actuel pour le Canada et les voyageurs canadiens est <b>faible</b>. Elle réévalue toutefois ce risque en permanence, à la lumière des éléments nouveaux dans ce dossier. Pour demeurer au fait des derniers développements, consultez les sites Web des <a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usherbrooke.ca%2Fbulletins%2Flien%2F8684%2F3ee238063ba0d%2FaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucXVlYmVjLmNhL3NhbnRlL3Byb2JsZW1lcy1kZS1zYW50ZS9hLXovY29yb25hdmlydXMtMjAxOS8%3D&amp;data=02%7C01%7CMaryse.Labbe%40USherbrooke.ca%7Ce856132746114ffdf6aa08d7ab2a2519%7C3a5a8744593545f99423b32c3a5de082%7C0%7C0%7C637166069807319537&amp;sdata=gi272PKt8cPIUqJHfsALJt%2BHzDar9cVtscTbCWMHOHM%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"><b>services de santé du Gouvernement du Québec</b></a> et de l'<a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usherbrooke.ca%2Fbulletins%2Flien%2F8684%2F3ee238063ba0d%2FaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FuYWRhLmNhL2ZyL3NhbnRlLXB1YmxpcXVlL3NlcnZpY2VzL21hbGFkaWVzLzIwMTktbm91dmVhdS1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy9mb2lyZS1hdXgtcXVlc3Rpb25zLmh0bWw%3D&amp;data=02%7C01%7CMaryse.Labbe%40USherbrooke.ca%7Ce856132746114ffdf6aa08d7ab2a2519%7C3a5a8744593545f99423b32c3a5de082%7C0%7C0%7C637166069807319537&amp;sdata=cgowY0LcmzAdl9MXle2kzqZWu%2Bbf7c%2BMVYNEmfFs%2F2k%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"><b>Agence de la santé publique du Canada</b></a>.</p>
<h4>Symptômes</h4>
<p class="bodytext">Bon nombre des symptômes de l'infection par le nouveau coronavirus (par exemple la fièvre, la toux et les difficultés respiratoires) sont pour ainsi dire identiques à ceux de la grippe saisonnière. L'Agence de la santé publique du Canada recommande aux personnes présentant ces symptômes <b>ET </b>ayant récemment voyagé dans la province du Hubei, en Chine, de consulter immédiatement un professionnel de la santé.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Le repos est essentiel pour se remettre de la grippe, mais l'Université ne peut interdire aux étudiants ou au personnel qui présentent des symptômes s'apparentant à ceux de la grippe de se présenter en classe ou de venir travailler, quels que soient leurs antécédents de voyage.</p>
<h4>Précautions</h4>
<p class="bodytext">Afin de contenir la propagation du coronavirus, l'Agence de la santé publique du Canada recommande de prendre les mêmes précautions que dans le cas du rhume ou de la grippe, à savoir&nbsp;:</p><ul><li>Lavez-vous les mains souvent avec du savon, sous l'eau      tiède du robinet, pendant au moins 20 secondes.</li><li>Utilisez un antiseptique pour les mains à base d'alcool      uniquement si le lavage à l'eau savonneuse n'est pas possible.</li><li>Toussez ou éternuez dans le creux de votre coude (et      non dans votre main), de manière à vous couvrir le nez et la bouche, afin      de réduire la propagation des germes.</li><li>Le plus rapidement possible après usage, jetez votre      papier-mouchoir et lavez-vous les mains.</li></ul><p class="bodytext">Si vous revenez d'un voyage ou envisagez vous rendre dans une région touchée, veuillez lire les conseils les plus récents de l'<a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usherbrooke.ca%2Fbulletins%2Flien%2F8684%2F3ee238063ba0d%2FaHR0cHM6Ly92b3lhZ2UuZ2MuY2EvZGVzdGluYXRpb25zL2NoaW5lP19nYT0yLjMzMzkyNzAxLjIwNDA0NDc0NTUuMTU4MDIzNTkwNy0xMDgzMTE3NjI5LjE1Nzk0MDA3NjU%3D&amp;data=02%7C01%7CMaryse.Labbe%40USherbrooke.ca%7Ce856132746114ffdf6aa08d7ab2a2519%7C3a5a8744593545f99423b32c3a5de082%7C0%7C0%7C637166069807329533&amp;sdata=NKKxrAuFfXVsuv21gSgGbWqoA55QfsAvl59Ea0anY0I%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"><b>Agence de la santé publique du Canada</b></a> à l'intention des voyageurs.</p>
